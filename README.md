# ACAI: Alert-Classifying AI for the Zwicky Transient Facility

Astronomy has been experiencing an explosive increase in the data volumes,
doubling every two years or so. At the forefront of this revolution,
the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://ztf.caltech.edu) – a robotic sky survey –
registers millions of transient events
(supernova explosions, asteroid detections, variable stars changing their brightness etc.)
in the dynamic sky every (clear) night.

Alert-Classifying AI (ACAI) is an open-source deep-learning framework
for the phenomenological classification of ZTF astronomical event alerts.
